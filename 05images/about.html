    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>First founded in 2019, Two Giants was created by two brothers set on making great games.<br> The name Two Giants means many different things, despite the founders being two six and a half feet tall people,<br> The mascots, Grince and Rav were meant to emphasize two of the key genres that inspired the kinds of stories and games we make,<br> a gargoyle for gothic fantasy, and a robot for cyberpunk.</p>
    <p>Alongside this, we felt that there was a significant change in how games were being made;<br> A movement towards making them more profitable and less accessible,<br> more visual and less interactive,<br> more corporate and less... fun.<br> The games industry was slowly becoming hollywood, and we had felt no passion coming out of the games being made.</p>
    <p>So we sought to change that! Two Giants walks in the shadows of giants much bigger than us,<br> the ones who came before us and the ones who made the games we remembered and loved.<br> We aspire to create fun, low-budget, and enjoyable games that don't demand much of you.<br> The ones reminiscent of the games made before, in how they're made, designed, and sold.</p>
